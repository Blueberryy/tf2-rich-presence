# TF2 Rich Presence
Discord Rich Presence for Team Fortress 2

![Preview image](preview.png)

(The actual program is nowhere near as nice looking as this)

## Download
With installer: [tf2_rich_presence_v1.7.3_installer.exe](https://github.com/Kataiser/tf2-rich-presence/releases/download/v1.7.3/tf2_rich_presence_v1.7.3_installer.exe) (7.48 MB)  
Without installer: [tf2_rich_presence_v1.7.3.zip](https://github.com/Kataiser/tf2-rich-presence/releases/download/v1.7.3/tf2_rich_presence_v1.7.3.zip) (8.97 MB)

## Installation and running
1. Extract tf2_rich_presence_v1.7.3.zip OR run tf2_rich_presence_v1.7.3_installer.exe, whichever you download.
2. Run `Launch TF2 with Rich Presence.exe`. Requires Steam and Discord to be running as well.
	- OR run `Launch Rich Presence alongside TF2.exe`. This doesn't automatically start Team Fortress 2.

For faster launching, you can add the first .exe to your taskbar or start menu, or to Steam as a non-Steam game.
