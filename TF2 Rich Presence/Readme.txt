TF2 Rich Presence ({tf2rpvnum}) by Kataiser
https://github.com/Kataiser/tf2-rich-presence
Built at {built}

INSTALLATION AND RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract "tf2_rich_presence_{tf2rpvnum}.zip" OR run "tf2_rich_presence_{tf2rpvnum}_self_extracting.exe", whichever you downloaded.
2. Run "Launch TF2 with Rich Presence.exe".
	- OR run "Launch Rich Presence alongside TF2.exe". This one doesn't automatically start Team Fortress 2.
	- Both require Steam and Discord to be running as well.

For faster launching, you can add the first EXE to your taskbar/start menu/desktop, or to Steam as a non-Steam game.

HELP! It broke! (Or otherwise functioned incorrectly)
