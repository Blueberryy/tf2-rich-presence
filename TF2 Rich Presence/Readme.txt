TF2 Rich Presence ({tf2rpvnum}) by Kataiser
https://github.com/Kataiser/tf2-rich-presence

INSTALLATION AND RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract tf2_rich_presence_{tf2rpvnum}.zip OR run tf2_rich_presence_{tf2rpvnum}_self_extracting.exe, whichever you downloaded.
2. Run "Launch TF2 with Rich Presence.exe". Requires Steam and Discord to be running as well.
	â€¢ OR run "Launch Rich Presence alongside TF2.exe". This doesn't automatically start Team Fortress 2.

For faster launching, you can add the first .exe to your taskbar or start menu, or to Steam as a non-Steam game.
