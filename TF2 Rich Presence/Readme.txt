TF2 Rich Presence ({tf2rpvnum}) by Kataiser
https://github.com/Kataiser/tf2-rich-presence
Built at {built}

INSTALLATION AND RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract "tf2_rich_presence_{tf2rpvnum}.zip" OR run "tf2_rich_presence_{tf2rpvnum}_self_extracting.exe", whichever you downloaded.
2. Run "Launch TF2 with Rich Presence.exe".
	- OR run "Launch Rich Presence alongside TF2.exe". This one doesn't automatically start Team Fortress 2.
	- Both require Discord and Steam to be running as well and will wait until the game and both programs are running. 

For faster launching, you can add the first EXE to your taskbar/start menu/desktop/etc or to Steam as a non-Steam game. Note than having Python installed is not required, but the VS 2015 redistributable is, which is automatically installed by many Steam games and so you should already have it.

HELP! It broke! (Or otherwise functioned incorrectly)
