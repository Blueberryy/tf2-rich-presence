Rrunning instructions:
The installer should have added shortcuts to your start menu and potentially desktop. The program won't automatically launch TF2, but does require Discord and Steam to be running as well, and will wait until the game and both programs are running. Note that having Python installed is not required.

HELP! It broke! (Or otherwise functioned incorrectly)
Feel free to create an issue by using Help -> Report bug/issue. If it's an installer or launching issue, go directly to https://github.com/Kataiser/tf2-rich-presence/issues.
