TF2 Rich Presence ({tf2rpvnum}) by Kataiser
https://github.com/Kataiser/tf2-rich-presence
Built at {built}

Installation and running:
  1. Extract "tf2_rich_presence_{tf2rpvnum}.zip" OR run "tf2_rich_presence_{tf2rpvnum}_self_extracting.exe", whichever you downloaded.
  2. Run "Launch TF2 with Rich Presence.exe".
    - OR run "Launch Rich Presence alongside TF2.exe". This one doesn't automatically start Team Fortress 2.
    - Both require Discord and Steam to be running as well and will wait until the game and both programs are running. 

For faster launching, you can add the first EXE to your taskbar/start menu/desktop/etc or to Steam as a non-Steam game. Note that having Python installed is not required.

HELP! It broke! (Or otherwise functioned incorrectly)
