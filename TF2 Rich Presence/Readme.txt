Installation and running:
  1. Extract "tf2_rich_presence_{tf2rpvnum}.zip" OR run "tf2_rich_presence_{tf2rpvnum}_self_extracting.exe", whichever you downloaded.
  2. Run "TF2 Rich Presence.exe" (doesn't automatically start Team Fortress 2). Requires Discord and Steam to be running as well and will wait until the game and both programs are running.

For faster launching, you can add it to your taskbar/start menu/desktop/etc or to Steam as a non-Steam game. Note that having Python installed is not required.

HELP! It broke! (Or otherwise functioned incorrectly)
